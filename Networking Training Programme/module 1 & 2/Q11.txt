1. SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH is a secure network protocol used for remote login and command execution over an encrypted connection. It prevents eavesdropping and attacks by encrypting all transmitted data. Port: 22
Steps:
The client sends a connection request to the SSH server.
The server responds with a key exchange for encryption.
The client authenticates using a password or SSH key.
Once authenticated, the user gets a secure shell session to execute commands remotely.

2. Telnet (Teletype Network)
Telnet is an older protocol used for remote access, but it lacks encryption, making it vulnerable to security threats. Port: 23
Steps:
The client initiates a plain-text connection to the Telnet server.
The server prompts for login credentials.
After authentication, the user gets a command-line session on the remote machine.
