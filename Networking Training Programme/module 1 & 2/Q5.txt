Duplicate IPs in a network cause conflicts, leading to connectivity issues, packet loss, and ARP mismatches. Devices with the same IP address will compete for communication. The network cannot distinguish between them. One or both devices may lose connection. Devices may lose connection, and network performance degrades due to unpredictable routing. One good practice is to always use DHCP to manage IP assignments or manually configure unique IPs.
